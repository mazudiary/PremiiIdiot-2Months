A beautiful, interactive, and romantic web page to celebrate a love journey. This project is a single-page HTML/CSS/JS site with:
- Advanced unlock animation: floating hearts, glowing names, poetic message, and smooth fade-in
- Custom modals and overlays
- Password-protected unlock with live countdown (with fine formatting)
- Memory gallery with lightbox
- Floating hearts, confetti, sparkles, and a custom logo & favicon
- Heartfelt Bengali and English messages



## Features

- **Romantic UI**: Modern, beautiful, and responsive design with custom gradients, heart/confetti animations, and a custom logo image (`images/premii_idiot.png`).
- **Favicon**: The browser tab icon uses your love logo (`images/premii_idiot.png`).
- **Password & Countdown**: The site is locked until a special date and time (17 August 2025, 00:48:00), with a live-updating countdown (with leading zeros and spacing) and a password prompt (password: `17062025`).
- **Smart Password Handling**: Custom error messages after 3, 5, and 10 wrong attempts, and whitespace-only input is treated as empty.
- **Unlock Animation**: After password match, enjoy a 5-second romantic animation with floating hearts, glowing text, sparkles, and a poetic message before the main page fades in.
- **Custom Modals**: All alerts and prompts use a custom, beautiful popup modal.
- **Memory Gallery**: Clickable photo/video gallery with lightbox and left/right navigation.
- **Love Poem Popup**: A custom modal with a Bengali and English love poem.
- **Promises & Love Letter**: Heartfelt promises and a love letter section.
- **Bengali Reminder**: A Bengali reminder about the power of small acts of care.
- **Download & Share**: Save the main card as an image or copy a sweet message.
